# OS_Concepts_Proj_3

Convolutional neural network is a powerful learning mechanism that was applied successfully to many computer vision tasks. In this project you are asked to run experiments using tensorflow.
The goal is to train a CNN to recognize images from the classical “cfar10” dataset. This dataset consists of
color images of size 32x32. There is a standard partitioning of the dataset into training and testing.

# Your program must include the following:
1. Your program must set the random seeds of python and tensorflow to 1 to make sure that your results are reproducible.
2. The training and testing in you program should not take more than 8 minutes.

# What you need to do
Design a network to solve this problem. You can use all the functionality of tensorflow, not only the parts
that were described in class.
